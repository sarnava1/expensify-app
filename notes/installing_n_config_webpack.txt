webpack can run babel for us

install webpack first
yarn add webpack

we have to first tell webpack what is the entry path to the project is..for us it is the app 
file in the src folder and we have to also specify the output file wherein all our js
will be.

every config is mentioned in the webpack.config.js file. the output file has been named
as bundle.js. Also __dirname gives us the complete path of the directory where we are in now 
and path.join is a node function which helps us to join paths.
