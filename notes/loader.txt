a loader lets us customise the behaviour of webpack when it sees a certain type of file.

We will be using the babel-loader for making webpack run babel on all the js files that will 
be added or modified during our work.

For doing that we have to include the rules in webpack.config file. also in the 
package.json file we can get rid of defining the presets of babel and we will write the 
presets of babel in another file known .babelrc which is json file for babel.

we will be adding loader for scss later on
