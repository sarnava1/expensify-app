Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also
capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

Actually it is a file in the public folder called bundle.js which is present 
along with the index.html file which has the links to all the scripts which are required
for the app to run. It is a single file which is created and which keeps tracks of all the 
dependencies and requirements of the app.
