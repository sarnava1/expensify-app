Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also
capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

Actually it is a file in the public folder called bundle.js which is present 
along with the index.html file which has the links to all the scripts which are required
for the app to run. It is a single file which is created and which keeps tracks of all the 
dependencies and requirements of the app.

See video lecture 47 and from there webpack portion starts.

after installing webpack we need to change the scripts object in the package.json file.
the previous build will be replaced by :
build: webpack --watch
webpack can run babel on its own but just including webpack in the package.json file will 
not do any good as we have to write the webpack.config.js file too.
