There should be no use of global modules. We should only use local modules and 
no global modules. We shall remove global modules like:

yarn global remove babel-cli

We shall add local modules like:

yarn add babel-cli

To use the local modules of live-server and babel-cli in the project we have to include them 
in the scripts object of the package.json file

We shall then run the project by:

yarn run serve for the live server 
yarn run build for the babel build
